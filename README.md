# Password Generator

## Description 

creating passwords can be a pain. Don't use any phrases you did previously, Can't be a password you've used in the past 2 months, use speical characters but don't use caps, etc. Who has time for any of that?? Thankfully we have built a JS application to generate our password for us.


## Installation

Clone into your repo using HTTPS


## Usage 

* step 1. vist the password generator sample page

* step 2. click generate password

* step 3. Follow the prompt to select a password length between 8 and 128. Numbers only

* step 4. Choose what kind of characters you want. For each prompt choose OK to include those characters in your password.

* step 5. Copy and paste you new awesome password into your application



## Credits

Thanks to the team at trilogy for the starter code, and hooking the JS up to the HTML using query selectors

Big ups to [Krupa](https://www.kirupa.com/html5/shuffling_array_js.htm) for laying out a shuffling function to help randomize the final password for extra security.
